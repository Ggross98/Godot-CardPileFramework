# Godot Card Pile Framework
A card game framework for Godot with C#.  
Developed and tested on Godot 4.4 with .Net 8.0.  
## Overview
There are several card-game framework/plugins available for Godot developers. However, similar work for developers who prefer to use C# is still in urgent need. Inspired by [simple-card-pile-ui](https://github.com/insideout-andrew/simple-card-pile-ui) and [card-framework](https://github.com/chun92/card-framework), this repository provides a lightweight framework using C#. You can use this framework to build a typical card-game (e.g., TCG and deck-building games) in few minutes.  
The main features are:  
* **Create and control card-objects**. Create card objects as Control nodes, customize its view and properties.
* **Manage card piles**. A simple manager for typical card-game with hand cards, draw and discard piles.
* **Save and load**. Save/load card and deck data in .json format.
* **UI animations**. Highly customizable animations and signal system for drag, drop, draw, use and discard cards.
To better show how the framework works, a demo of turn-based card-battle game is available.
