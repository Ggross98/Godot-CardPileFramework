## Overview
There are several card-game framework/plugins available for GDScript developers. However, similar work developed with C# is still in urgent need. 
Inspired by the [simple-card-pile-ui](https://github.com/insideout-andrew/simple-card-pile-ui) and [card-framework](https://github.com/chun92/card-framework), this repository provides a flexible framework for Godot developers who prefer to write C# scripts. The main features are:  
* Create and control card-objects as Control nodes.
* Manage drawing, discarding and hand piles.
* Save and load card data in .json format.
* Highly customizable UI animations.
* A card-battle demo to show how the plugin works.
